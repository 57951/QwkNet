# Acknowledgements

This file acknowledges those who have contributed to the QWK specifications, BBS software, and open source ecosystems that made QWK.NET possible.

## QWK Specifications

QWK.NET is built upon the QWK packet format specifications developed for offline mail readers.

We gratefully acknowledge the many contributors, both named and unnamed, who authored and maintained the QWK specifications, as well as the QWKE (QWK Extended) format.

Sincere appreciation extends to William McBrine (wmcbrine), whose organised collection of documents greatly benefits all implementers and keeps the formats accessible to new generations of developers. We thank him for his contribution to preservation and documentation.

## BBS Community

The library exists to preserve and work with historical BBS packet files and to open the door to new software. We acknowledge the bulletin board system authors, mail door developers, and BBS communities of the 1980s and 1990s who created and used the QWK format, and those who continue to do so today.

## Open Source Ecosystems

QWK.NET is built using the .NET platform and benefits from the open source .NET ecosystem. The library relies on standard .NET libraries for core functionality, enabling dependency-free operation whilst maintaining compatibility with modern .NET development practices.
